# Design System: Habit Tracker Patchbay

## Overview

**Creative North Star: "A backlit machine-room jackfield."**

Habits become lanes, days become contacts, and a checked day is a closed amber circuit. The interface is dense enough to operate daily but quiet enough to show the pattern of consistency without decorative metrics.

## Colors

Black glass is the ground. Signal amber is intentionally singular: it marks completed circuits, labels, and the one action that adds a lane.

### Primary
- **Signal amber** (#e4ab4e): completed patches, headings, and active controls.

### Neutral
- **Machine black** (#121212): page ground and inactive contact center.
- **Console glass** (#1b1b1a): schedule surface.
- **Instrument paper** (#e7e2d8): active text.
- **Quiet metal** (#8e887f): inactive labels and metadata.
- **Rule metal** (#45413b): grid lines.

## Typography

**Display Font:** Avenir Next, Trebuchet MS, sans-serif
**Body Font:** Avenir Next, Trebuchet MS, sans-serif
**Label Font:** Avenir Next, Trebuchet MS, sans-serif

**Character:** utilitarian display type with small uppercase instrument labels and tabular numerals.

### Hierarchy
- **Display** (700, clamp 3rem–7rem, .87): the operational thesis.
- **Headline** (500, clamp 2rem–4rem, .9): schedule title.
- **Body** (400, 13–16px, 1.55): helper copy and lane names.
- **Label** (400, 10px, uppercase, .15em): machine metadata.

## Layout

The page is a single vertical console: readouts, then the 14-day schedule, then the lane input. The table keeps its dense desktop width and becomes an internally scrollable rail on small screens so the day contacts remain legible.

## Elevation & Depth

No shadows are used inside the console. Depth comes from black-on-glass tonal layering, one-pixel rules, and an amber signal glow only on completed contacts.

## Shapes

All surfaces and controls are square. The patch cell is a crosshair, not a checkbox; the only circular shape is the tiny contact node.

## Components

### Patch schedule
- **Rest:** dark crosshair with quiet rule ink.
- **Completed:** amber crosshair and center node with a restrained glow.
- **Responsive:** the schedule scrolls inside its own rail; the document itself never gains horizontal overflow.

### Inputs / Fields
- **Style:** transparent field with an amber label and quiet bottom rule.
- **Action:** `Patch lane` uses an amber rectangular control.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do:
- **Do** use one amber signal for state, so completion reads immediately.
- **Do** preserve the fixed lane/day grid on desktop and the contained rail on mobile.

### Don't:
- **Don't** add colorful mood states or progress rings.
- **Don't** replace the schedule with a generic set of habit cards.
